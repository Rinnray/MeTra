# MeTra
MeTra is a fairly simple **Me**dia **Tra**cker. I got tired of there being no simple but good way to keep track of what I want to watch and have watched and so on (unless I quit searching right before finding it).
One way I've kept a track of it before is using Obsidian, but it still didn't feel quite right, specially the syncing and needing plugins for a nice system.

So I decided to just make my own, which also gives me a good project to work and practice my programming on 😁.
It's also the first real project I make the repo public for.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️
Everything is obviously still work in progress. As I'm still learning and practicing, the project will not be perfect.
So if you decide to use it, be it my hosted instance or if you host it yourself, be ready for potential issues.

The text below was already in the README and will be changed at some point.

## Developing
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building
To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
